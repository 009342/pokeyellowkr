# Pokémon Yellow Korean Fan translation

This is a disassembly of Pokémon Yellow Korean Fan Translation Project.

This is my first time of using github so I don't know is it right to using like this.

This source code is version 0.99

Few bugs related to korean font extension and Vram bank controls are remained.

(Flankly Speaking, I don't know it really built)

It is only allowed to use as studying purpose
Thanks for pret, who makes Disassembly of Pokemon Yellow(E)
